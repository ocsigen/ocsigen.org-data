=How to use a database with Eliom?=

You can use any database library that you want.

[[http://pgocaml.forge.ocamlcore.org/|PGOCaml]]
is a good choice, and so is
<<a_manual project="macaque"|Macaque>>
[[|Macaque]].
You can mix both in the same application. Both can be used in a
cooperative way with Lwt.

Unlike PGOcaml, Macaque has the ability to build the request
dynamically. However, Macaque does not support all Postgresql
features.
