=How to call a server-side function from client-side?=

It is possible to call server-side functions in client-side code using
the {{{~%}}} syntax. For security reasons, these functions must first
be declared explicitely as "server functions" (with the type of their
argument).

<<code language="ocaml"|
let f x = ...

let%client f_rpc = ~%(Eliom_client.server_function [%derive.json: int] f)

...

[%client ... f_rpc 4 ... ]
>>

The server-side function ({{{f}}} in the example) needs to return an
Lwt value.

Server functions are just syntactic sugar for pathless services
returning OCaml values.

Note that you need to install {{{ppx_deriving}}}, and load our JSON
{{{ppx_deriving}}} plugin in your project. The plugin is available as
the Ocamlfind package {{{js_of_ocaml.deriving.ppx}}}.

If the function takes a more complex type, this type must have been
declared with {{{ppx_deriving}}}. For example,

<<code language="ocaml"|
type t = int * string [@@deriving json]
>>

Our infrastructure provides server-side data validation of the data
sent, and prevents malformed data from crashing the server.
