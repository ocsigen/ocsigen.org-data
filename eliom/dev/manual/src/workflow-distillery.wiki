= Eliom's Distillery==

The easiest way to initialize, compile, and run a project in
Ocsigen/Eliom is to use the Eliom distillery {{{eliom-distillery}}}.

It is self-documenting (refer to {{{eliom-distillery -help}}} and the
generated {{{README}}}), but here is a bit information on how to work
with it.

<<outline depth="2"| <<header| **Table of contents** >> >>



=== Project Initialization

The {{{eliom-distillery}}} creates projects from templates.
To see all available templates, you can use
<<code language="shell"|
$ eliom-distillery -list-templates
>>

Template "basic" create a very simple project (makefiles and configuration file
and main service).

To create your project, do:

<<code language="shell"|
$ eliom-distillery -name <name> -template basic.ppx [-target-directory <dir>]
>>

This creates a project named {{{<name>}}} from the {{{"basic.ppx"}}}
template in the directory {{{<dir>}}} or {{{<name>}}} by default.
The project name should be a valid name for an OCaml compilation unit.
The project directory contains the following files

 * {{{<name>.eliom}}} \\
   This is your initial source file.
   All Eliom files (*.eliom, *.eliomi) in this directory are
   automatically considered.  To add a .ml/.mli file to your project,
   add it to the variable SERVER_FILES or CLIENT_FILES in
   {{{Makefile.options}}}.

 * {{{static/}}} \\
   The content of this folder is statically served. It contains
   initially a basic CSS file for your project.

 * {{{Makefile.options}}} \\
   Configure your project here!

 * {{{name.conf.in}}} \\
   This file is a template for the configuration file for
   ocsigenserver. You will rarely need to edit it: it can be
   personalized through variables in {{{Makefile.options}}}.
   In particular, this way, the installation rules and the
   configuration files remains coherent.

 * {{{Makefile}}} \\
   This contains all rules necessary to build, test, and run your
   Eliom application. You should avoid modifying it. See below for the
   relevant targets.

 * {{{README}}} \\
   An explanation of how to compile, test, install, and run your
   application

=== Compilation & Running: Read the README

You can just run
<<code language="shell"|
$ make test.byte
>>
or
<<code language="shell"|
$ make test.opt
>>
to compile your project and run ocsigenserver with it.

Please refer to the generated README file for further hints
on how to work with your project.

=== Using other templates

If you want to start from a more complete or more specific template,
you can get other templates from the internet, such as
"ocsigen-start". You can either install these templates into eliom's
own directory (this is what their installer generally does), or, if
doing so is not practical, you can use the {{{ELIOM_DISTILLERY_PATH}}}
environment variable to point to your templates. This environment
variable is a colon-separated list of absolute paths (that is, {{{export ELIOM_DISTILLERY_PATH=/usr/lib/template1:/usr/local/lib/template2}}}).

The template name will be the directory basename (template1 and template2 for
the given example). If you want to create a new project based on template1, you can use

<<code language="shell"|
$ eliom-distillery -name example -template template1
>>

=== Write other templates

You can also write your own templates and add them by using the previous
described method.

By default, {{{eliom-distillery}}} will copy all files in the template
directory. If you want to ignore some files, you can list them in a file
{{{.eliomignore}}}.

For some projects, like {{{Ocsigen Start}}}, some project names are reserved
(like {{{os}}}). You can list all reserved project names in a file
{{{.eliomreserve}}}.

{{{eliom-distillery}}} will also replace all {{{%%%PROJECT_NAME%%%}}} (resp.
{{{%%%MODULE_NAME%%%}}}) by the project name (resp. by the project name and the
first letter is capitalized).

For examples, see pre-defined templates like {{{basic.ppx}}} and
{{{os.pgocaml}}}.
